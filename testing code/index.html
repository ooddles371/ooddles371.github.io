		Starting my first full week in Charlotte, I’m getting a sense of the place and how to avoid the spiderwebs.  Got my first chance to run on the Greenway (a paved path along a stream) Monday that runs through the UNCC campus and is very conveniently marked every 800 meters.  Great place to do pace runs (tempo runs) although this one didn’t go exactly according to plan as it turns out the inhaler (I have exercised induced asthma) I’ve been using ran out last week and my replacement one didn’t show up until after the workout.  That being said, if you take away the inability to breath, the legs were doing alright in adjusting to the heat.</br></br>

		On Thursday I had the workout that I had been dreading for a while.  I use the word dreading because I knew it was a big workout on the horizon and I hadn’t been feeling as recovered as I would have liked the past few weeks.  However, after removing the aerobic fartlek from the long run last weekend, I finally got back on top of my game and it showed in the workout, putting up splits that were significantly faster than the previous year while at the same time going further in hot, humid and unfortunately sunny conditions.  I didn’t realize how worried I’d been until afterwards when the relief hit me.  Probably shouldn’t have built up a single workout that much in my mind, but it’s behind me now and hopefully I’ll learn a lesson from it.</br></br>

		This week also had the last longer than a marathon long run, where I ended up cruising in the low 5:40’s for the majority of the effort after naturally working into the run.

		Had my third workout in Charlotte Tuesday morning, averaging just under five minute pace off the track on the Greenway before jumping back on the track and ratcheting down the pace to simulate what will hopefully take place around the twenty mile mark of the race.  Overall it was a great morning workout in a light mist just before I got on the plane to fly back to Seattle for the last few weeks of training.</br></br>

		On the plane ride back I managed to catch a sore throat which persisted through the weekend and made the workout on Friday just a tad tougher than it would have been otherwise.  And I gotta say, having only thirty seconds rest adds up by the end of five repeats, the break between sets was greatly appreciated.</br></br>

		The last real long run of the season was Sunday, something that I had to be pretty careful with too.  With the mileage dropping, the risk of overrunning efforts increases and I found myself in the mid 5:40’s at one point and had to slow myself down.  This will only become more of a factor over the last two weeks as the mileage continues to drop in preparation for the marathon.</br></br>

		So the way I can tell that mileage is severely dropping is that it no longer takes me 20 minutes into a run to start feeling good.  I can pop out the door and be in the 5:50’s right away, and then I have to focus to make sure I’m not running too fast.  Had my last real workout on Tuesday, a short pace run on the track.  Everything from that point onward are just efforts to keep my body from going flat.  An appropriate saying would be, “the hay’s in the barn.”  But I’ve found I don’t like that saying as it seems to imply you don’t have to stay mentally focused even if the physical work has been done.

			<p>Mid-Race in the USA 20km Champs</p>
		</div>
		The 20k USA Championships kick-started this week.  Quick shout out to elite athlete coordinator John Tolbert who’s done an absolutely first class job every year I’ve been to New Haven.  However, while there was a quality field assembled for the US Championships, it was the weather that defined the day, low 70 ‘s at 8:30 in the morning with very high humidity and clear blue skies provided a glaring sun.  It was going to be a battle of survival.</br></br>
				
		We started the first three miles, 4:52, 4:58 & 4:52 (15:16), with no one willingly taking the lead.  Under normal conditions I would chalk this up to a slow start and expected the pace to pick up shortly.  Today though, under the sun and humidity, it proved to be exactly the opposite, the fastest 5k of the day.  Throughout the next 5k the lead shifted back and forth with Matt Llano (20) and Ahmed Osman (14) doing most of the leading while I stayed at the back of the front group of eight trying to stay relaxed.  Just after we hit the 10k mark in 30:38 (4:58, 4:50, 5:04), we had an unexpected visitor for a block or so (see above photo).</br></br>

		At this point everyone had been taking in water and dousing themselves at most water stops, but the cumulative heat was beginning to take a toll.  Mile splits that are more often seen in pace runs on the track 4:54, 5:14, 4:52, were becoming harder to hit with the strain evident in the whole pack as moves were covered at increasingly slower rates.  Shortly before we entered East Rock (9th mile), Girma Mecheso made a move going around a corner (corners and turnarounds are always places to pay attention as they are easy places to create separation, especially later in races) that fractured the pack permanently for the first time.</br></br>

		</div>
		
		The split up the hill was 5:12, but it felt as if it was the fastest of the day.  Cresting the apex Girma accelerated again down the windy hill stringing out the remaining pack.  At this point I was hurting and beginning to lose the battle of keeping my right side cramp under control, but I was still determined to not allow myself to be gapped by the leaders.  We hit the eleventh mile in 4:53 on Whitney Ave.  A side note here, the last two and a half miles are a straight shot on Whitney Ave, the longest finishing stretch on the USARC!  By the start of the last mile we were whittled down to three, Girma, Luke and I, in that order.  I was bouncing on and off the back of the pack, deviating between giving into my cramp and deciding that “this is not going to be point where I give up and drop off.”  Right around twelve miles (4:48) I lost my mental battle and slipped off the back of the front two and saw my chance at a fourth national championship running away from me.  Then, with around 400-600 meters left, the road splits and you can see the finish line for the first time.  At this point, after seeing Luke looking back frequently, I finally found a little competitive spirit and started to kick.  Like a snowball going downhill it was a slow thing in forming, but by the time I caught up to Luke I shot right by him and almost got Girma too, unfortunately, he had a little extra left in the tank to hold me off until I ran out of ground and he reached the finish.</br></br>

		Looking back I am pleased that I was able to resurrect myself and close well enough pick up one spot and almost grab the win.  On the other hand, I am disappointed that mentally I made all the right decisions, even on the last stretch where I continually caught back up to the top two many times, until right after twelfth mile and it cost me the win.  It’ll take a good race at Chicago to get this one off my mind.  Afterwards I won the drug testing lottery which eliminated the chance of a cool down but was a really good way to make sure to get re-hydrated.</br></br>

		Starting my first 150 mile week with a 15 mile day?  Sure, why not!  I’ll just hit 120 miles in the next 5 days.  Not the way I would have planned it, but what can you do with a race on Monday followed by a cross country flight?  A mostly successful week as it contained a solid race effort on Monday, a strong workout on Thursday, and a painfully fatigued long run on Saturday.</br></br>

		On Monday I hit a new PR for number of mile repeats on the track and was quite pleased with the effort as I averaged 4:35 over 12 repeats.  I was in flats after the first set which seems to give me a boost of about four seconds a mile, useful that.  On the other hand, this workout wore me out again and it showed as by the time I got to the secondary workout early Thursday morning I was not completely recovered and failed to stay at 5:00 pace for the last 45 minutes of the workout, drifting back towards 5:10 where I started.

		</div>
		Later that day I flew out to Charlotte, NC where my coach, Alex Gibby, is now located for a twelve day training trip.  The purpose of the trip is to be under the watchful eye of the taskmaster for the last few major workouts so any tweaks that need to be made can be.  On a side note, I had forgotten over the past four years since leaving Williamsburg what the humidity can be like in this area of the country…and the amount of spiderwebs in the area.  I’ll be sticking to the wider paths in the morning until other people have had a chance to transverse the thinner trails.

		Well back up to 140 miles again this week, and surprise, surprise, is it easier to hit when you don’t have to jam most of the mileage into the first four days of the week.  Also, a three hour long run doesn’t hurt either.  My first workout this week was three five miles segments on the track with the last set in flats starting at marathon pace and dropping.  Throughout all three sets I felt under control and relaxed which left me excited at how my training was progressing.  At the end of the week, I had my first three hour long run which I was apprehensive about going in.  However, it turned out very well, possibly too well as I ended up running the last seven to eight miles averaging 5:23 pace with an overall pace of 5:38 (2:28 marathon pace).  A note about long runs and workouts in general during marathon prep.  During the marathon your body needs re hydration and refueling, so it would behoove a person to prepared for this.  I set out water bottles (at this point filled with gatorade, use whatever sparks your fancy) about three miles apart for long runs and workouts.  This is easy to do at my long run location, a six mile stretch of road, as I only need to set up at two spot.  This way my body gets used to taking in fluid and processing it every five kilometers as it will be during the marathon.  By personal experience, this also leads to much quicker long runs and I have to reign myself in at times to not over run the efforts as I might have on Sunday.</br></br>

		This was a down week leading into the 20k US Championships next Monday with the progression run on Tuesday being the only major workout.  As has been the trend, this progression run dropped in pace faster than the previous two ending with four miles at or below 4:52 pace on the track.</br></br>

		Going into a race I like to front load my mileage.  For example, the first four days are on par with a 140 mile week, while the last three days are on the very easy side, leading into Monday’s race.  This is a compromise that has worked out well for me in the past.  First it gives me a few days to recover and feel fresh going into a race and second it allows me to keep my training levels relatively even outside of a short period to continue working on my long term goals.

		Well these were an interesting two interesting weeks as they included my move (driving) from Ann Arbor, Michigan to my temporary training grounds of Bainbridge Island, Washington (right outside of Seattle).  To avoid having to do any workouts while driving I squished them into the beginning of the week and held my maintenance run plus and long run for my travel days.  While this was nice for the trip portion, I paid a heavy price during the beginning of my first 140 mile week in terms of workload, hitting ~90 miles in the first four days and putting in a sub-par performance in my fartlek pace-wise (even if the effort level was high).  On the other hand, that wasn’t anything that sitting on my duff for 9-10 hours a day in a car couldn’t fix and by the time Sunday came around I was ready for a surprisingly good long run in Bismarck, ND.  If you ever find yourself in that area, check out the series of parks and trails along the Missouri River for a good run.  Also of note driving across the northern United States, besides the beauty of open country, were the number of bugs I ran across.  It got to the point where I had to wash off my headlights when I got to gas stations…not something I’ve experienced before.
